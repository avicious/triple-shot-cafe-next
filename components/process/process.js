        <h3>Measure and grind the coffee beans</h3>
        <p>
          Measure out the desired amount of whole coffee beans and grind them to
          the appropriate size, depending on the brewing method you are using.

        <h3>Heat water to the correct temperature</h3>
        <p>
          For most brewing methods, the ideal water temperature is between 195째F
          to 205째F (90째C to 96째C). Use a thermometer to measure the water
          temperature or bring it to a boil and let it cool for a few minutes.

        <h3>Pour the hot water over the coffee</h3>
        <p>
          Slowly pour the hot water over the coffee in a circular motion, making
          sure all the grounds are evenly saturated. The water should be poured
          in stages or pulses, depending on the brewing method.

        <h3>Allow the coffee to brew</h3>
        <p>
          Depending on the brewing method, allow the coffee to brew for a few
          minutes. During this time, the water will extract the coffee's flavor
          and aroma.

        <h3>Serve and enjoy</h3>
        <p>
          Once the coffee has finished brewing, remove the brewing device and
          serve the coffee immediately. You can add cream, milk, or sweeteners
          to taste.
